In a significant development for the Pakistan squad in the T20 World Cup 2024, Imad Wasim has been announced as a replacement for Azam Khan in the match against India. Imad Wasim, a seasoned all-rounder, has been declared fit and available for the high-voltage clash on June 9. The change comes after Azam Khan was excluded from the team's batting practice and faced criticism on social media, leading to the deletion of all his posts on Instagram.

Azam Khan's performance in T20Is for Pakistan has been underwhelming, managing only 88 runs in 13 innings. Meanwhile, Imad Wasim was ruled out of Pakistan's opening match against the USA due to a side injury. Mehran Mumtaz has been asked to prepare as a potential replacement for Imad Wasim in the T20 World Cup 2024, ensuring that the team is well-prepared for any unforeseen circumstances.
