The IMF and Pakistan are in discussions for a new Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Significant progress has been made in the negotiations. The IMF's focus has shifted from budget deficit to 'primary balance'. They are now prioritizing 'elastic income sources' in their tax policy. The government has agreed to partially reverse provincial transfers under the 7th NFC Award.

Furthermore, the petroleum development levy on petroleum products will be increased. The IMF has also requested a reduction in current expenditure. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has set an ambitious tax target of Rs13tr for FY25. The negotiations are still ongoing virtually. The IMF has also suggested the creation of a national council to harmonize taxes between the center and provinces. Additionally, the IMF has demanded the imposition of tax on the farm sector.
