Narendra Modi has been sworn in for his third term as India's Prime Minister. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 240 seats in the 543-member lower house, 32 short of a majority. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition, of which the BJP is a part, will have 293 seats. Modi is reliant on a motley assortment of minor parties to govern, with larger coalition parties having demanded hefty concessions in exchange for their support. The ceremony at the presidential palace on Sunday evening included the swearing in of around 30 ministers from the NDA coalition. Security was tight in New Delhi on Sunday, with thousands of troops and police deployed as regional leaders flew in for the ceremony and following state banquet.
